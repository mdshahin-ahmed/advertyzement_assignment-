## About project

- I used bootstrap for the made navbar
- I fetch the data inside a function and I pass the data navbar by props
  And inside the navbar, I got the function and set it to the nav link's onclick event handler.
- When I click on the button the function is being called and the data is being loaded.
- The loaded data I stored in a state and I passed the state as a props in the user component.
  -Inside the user component, I got the data as props. And set the UI dynamically
